feat: `@ts-rest/react-query` use object-syntax in react-query to support [@tanstack/react-query@^5.0.0](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/migrating-to-v5)
- note: This does **not** implement a complete migration to v5 but lays the groundwork to get the ball rolling and apps running again.

feat: `@ts-rest/vue-query` add @tanstack/vue-query@^5.0.0 as peer dependency
