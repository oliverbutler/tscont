# Introduction

ts-rest provides an RPC-like client side interface over your existing REST APIs, as well as allowing you define a _separate_ contract implementation rather than going for a 'implementation is the contract' approach, which is best suited for smaller or simpler APIs.

If you have non typescript consumers, a public API, or maybe want to add type safety to your existing REST API? ts-rest is what you're looking for!
